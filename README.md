# ML-Project-Accent-ID
## Introduction
For functions in modern smart devices like smart phones or laptops, some voice recognition functions can be enabled to achieve dictation or AI assistant. However, such mechanisms have problems when applied to complicated language environments. In China, there are many different accents or dialects that sounds too different to be processed under a standardized voice library. Many cases have shown that the current voice recognition system is not enough for complex language system, especially for languages that have distinctive accents. To ensure the accuracy of the recognition, this program offers an initial step to the solution: build an identification system which could classify which accent or dialects, so that the device could then find the corresponding database to interpret the commands.
